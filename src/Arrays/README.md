1.1
<hr>
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?
<hr>
1.2
<hr>
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
<hr>
1.3
<hr>
Write a method to replace all the spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to  hold the additional characters, and that you are given the 'true' length of the string.
<hr>
Ex:
<hr>
Input 'Mr John Smith    ', 13
<hr>
Output: 'Mr%20John%20Smith
<hr>
1.4
<hr>
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. A palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words
<hr>
Ex:
<hr>
Input: Tact Coa
<hr>
Output: True (permutations : 'taco cat', 'ataco cta', ... etc)
<hr>
1.5
<hr>
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a chararacter, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit(or zero edits) away.
<hr>
Ex:
<hr>
pale, ple -> true
<hr>
pales, pale -> true
<hr>
pale, bale -> true
<hr>
pale, bake -> false
<hr>
1.6
<hr>
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the 'compressed' string would not become smaller than the original, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only upper and lowercase letters (a-z)
<hr>
1.7
<hr>
Given an image represented by an NxN  matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
<hr>
1.8
<hr>
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
<hr>
1.9
<hr>
Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring. (e.g 'waterbottle' is a rotation of 'erbottlewat' )
