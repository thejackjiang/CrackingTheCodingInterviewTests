Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and columns. The robot can only move right or down, but certain cells are off limits such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right

A magic index in an arrayA[0...n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in Array A.
What if the values are not distinct?

Write a method to return all subsets of a set.

Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the * operator. You can use addition, subtraction and bit shifting but you should minimize the number of these operations.

Towers of Hanoi: In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom(i.e. each disk sits on top of even larger one). You can have the following constraints:
1. only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. a disk is slid off the top of a one tower onto another tower
3. a disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk
Write a problem to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks

Write a method to compute all permutations of a string whose characters are not necessarily unique. The list of permutations should not be duplictes.

Parens: Implement an algorithm to print all the valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.
Example
input : 3
output: ((())), (()()), ()(()), ()()()

Paint fill: Implement the paint fill function that one might see on any image editing programs. That is, given a screen represented by a 2d array of colors, a point and a new color, fill the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color

Coins: Given an infinite number of quarters, dimes, nickels and penies, write code to calculate the number of ways representing n cents.

Write an algorithm to print all the ways of arranging eight queens on a 8x8 chess board so that none of them share the same row, columns, or diagonal. In this case diagonal means all diagonals, not just the two that bisect the board

You have a stack of n boxes with w width, h height and d depths. The boxes cannot be rotate and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above in its width, height, and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack. The height is the sum of the heights of each box.

Given a boolean expression consisting of the symbols, 0(false), 1(true), &(AND), ||(OR), ^(XOR) and a desired boolean result, implement a function to count the number of ways of parenthesizing the expression such that it evaluates to result. The expression should be fully parenthesized. (0)^(1) but not extraneously(((0))^(1)))
