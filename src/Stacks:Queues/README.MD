Decribe how you would use a single array to implement three stacks
<hr>
3.2
How would you design a stack in which push and pop has a functiopn min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.

Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might opple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfSTacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push(0 and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identical to a single stack.

Implement a MyQueue class wich implements a queue using two stacks.
<hr>
3.5
Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional stack, but you may not copy elements into another data structure. The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty.

An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats. operate on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" based on arrival time of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a cat or a dog and will receive the oldest animal of that type. They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create a data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You can use the built in linkedlis tdata structures.
