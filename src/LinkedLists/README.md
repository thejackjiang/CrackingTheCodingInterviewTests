2.1
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
<hr>
2.2
Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list
<hr>
2.3
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle(any not first or last) of a singely linked list, given only access to that node
<hr>
2.4
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x comes before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within a list, the value of x only needs to be after the elements. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the 'right' partition.
<hr>
2.5
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list
<hr>
2.6
Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome
<hr>
2.7
Given two singly linked list, determine if the two list intersect. Return the intersecting node. Note the intersection is defined based on the reference, not the value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same by reference as the jth node of the second linked list, they are intersecting.

2.8
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node a the begining of the loop.
